Hosts will be able to posts events in the their local area.

At present all events will fit under one of the following categories;

- Family - parent and baby class in local library, church, hwb
- Sport/Health/Wellbeing - tennis, football (5a side / 11a side)
- Culture (plays, music)
- Food & Drink (new menu (pizzeria offering a gluten free / vegatarian evening), drink tasting(wine bar with a new shipment of french wine / pop up bar offering local micro brewery beer))

Users will be able to search for events that interest them depending on when there are available
